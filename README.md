# KSU-Combustion-TunerStudioFiles

Started by Jonathan Strickland
The main idea:
All tunes will be stored in the repo and changes will be pushed whenever they are made.
This will keep a rolling log of all of the tune changes and provide a reliable, always accessible backup for MS3 tunes. 

How to implement:
Download Github desktop
Install git
Go to this repo & create a local clone
Open the local clone
Copy/store the TunerStudio project folder for KSU inside the local repo clone
Leave the tune name as CurrentTune

All of the extra files should be ignored by github through the .gitignore filters setup for the repo
